/**
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except 
for one. Find that single one. 

 You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only 
constant extra space. 

 
 Example 1: 
 Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
 
 Example 2: 
 Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
 
 Example 3: 
 Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 
 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
 -3 * 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10⁴ 
 Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears 
only once.
