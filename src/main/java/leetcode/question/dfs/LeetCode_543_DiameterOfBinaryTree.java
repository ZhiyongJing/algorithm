/**
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. 


 The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any 
two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. 

 The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges 
between them. 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
 -100 <= Node.val <= 100
