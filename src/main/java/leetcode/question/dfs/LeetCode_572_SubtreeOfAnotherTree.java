/**
Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a 
subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false 
otherwise. 

 A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and 
all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a 
subtree of itself. 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
 

 Example 2: 
 
 
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000]. 
 The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000]. 
 -10‚Å¥ <= root.val <= 10‚Å¥ 
 -10‚Å¥ <= subRoot.val <= 10‚Å¥
