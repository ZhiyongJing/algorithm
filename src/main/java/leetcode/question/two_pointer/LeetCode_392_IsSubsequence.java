/**
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false 
otherwise. 

 A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original 
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the 
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of 
"abcde" while "aec" is not). 

 
 Example 1: 
 Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
 
 Example 2: 
 Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 
 
 Constraints: 

 
 0 <= s.length <= 100 
 0 <= t.length <= 10‚Å¥ 
 s and t consist only of lowercase English letters. 
 

 
Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming 
s, say 
s1, s2, ..., sk where 
k >= 10‚Åπ, and you want to check one by one to see if 
t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
